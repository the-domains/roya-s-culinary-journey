It's been a soup kind of week as i've felt colder than usual walking around in a sweater and boots, but still seeing some people frolicking around in shorts and flip flops!

This German inspired & _requested_ soup is packed with flavourful meatballs, bite-size cauliflower florets, carrots, and little pastas, in a super clear homemade vegetable stock. A splash of vinegar, and chopped chives finish this comforting and satisfying soup.
