Give me anything and I'll roast it.. As it's my absolute favourite cooking method other than sous-vide.

Roasted herbed chicken breasts with fresh sprigs of thyme, marjoram & rosemary, garlic and lemon zest. Alongside roasted potatoes, carrots, onions, and red bell peppers. A lovely sauce made using the tray juices mixed with mustard and lemon juice, and chopped chives.

Simple one tray cooking, but absolute comfort food.
