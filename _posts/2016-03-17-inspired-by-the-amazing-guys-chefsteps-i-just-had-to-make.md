Inspired by the amazing guys @chefsteps, I just had to make this Pixar-styled, classic French dish lovingly known as ratatouille!

Eggplants, green and yellow zucchinis, and plum tomatoes are thinly sliced (thank you mandolin) and layered on top of a lovely stewing sauce, olive oil, and rosemary. Baked for 1.5 hours.. Just can't wait.
